# webaudio-sequence-player
Plays songs that can be built up from smaller sequences, allowing control over the song (separate volume-outputs, loop points, and more) while it plays. Will be able to play different kind of instruments, both sample-based and synthesized.

some use cases:
- play a static song
- generate a song based on variables
- drum/sample sequencer
- adaptive game-music that can seamlessly transition based on gameplay

This project is far from finished at the moment, feel free to help out!
